  Solated from the tourist crowds, yet just a few kilometers 
  from the tourist centers, lies the fishing village Vinkuran. 
  The private apartments above Vinkuran Bay and Soline Cove guarantee 
  a pleasant and peaceful vacation. Vinkuran has a sheltered beach along pine trees.
  It is ideal for nature lovers who enjoy peace and quiet. 
  There is a store, restaurant and cafÃ© in the village.
  Vinkuran has always been famed for its stone. 
  In ancient times stone blocks were taken from the 
  quarry near Vinkuran - 
  Cave Romane for the construction of Pula's Arena. 
  Today, during the summer months an art colony for 
  sculptors is held in the quarry.`
